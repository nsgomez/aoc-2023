USAGE
-----------------------
Use kotlinc to compile each file into a .jar file, then
run the program by passing the input filename as an
argument, which should look something like this:

    kotlinc part1.kt -d part1.jar
    java -jar part1.jar input.txt

But I wouldn't know to be honest, I hacked this together
in IntelliJ IDEA on Windows instead of my Linux VM and
just kept pressing the Run button. (My friend said it's
not a race, but a wise man once told me, "Gotta go fast")
